    <h4>Clearance Item Policy</h4>
    <p>You will not be charged for your order until the order ships.<br>
      We search for clearance items at each of our 5 locations so it may take longer for those items to be pulled.
      If
      you are placing a Next Day Air or 2<sup>nd</sup> Day Air order the order processing time will be delayed
      while we
      check all of our locations for the discontinued item.<br>
      If we don't find the item, your order packing slip will show it as "Discontinued" and you will not receive
      that
      item.</p>

      <div>

          <li>When you place an order, a $1 charge is made to your card and then is voided.</li>
          <li>Your card will be charged when your items are packed and shipped.</li>

      <h3> Q: How do I exchange or return a gift I received from your store?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>If you are looking to do an exchange (or credit) the returned item(s) must be in as-new condition
          with
          original packaging, tags and accessories*. For an exchange please include a note with your contact

          we can work out either additional payment from you or a credit for you for the difference. If you
          want to
          return the item for credit we will send you a University Book Store Gift Card with an amount equal

          returned item on it. The gift card can be used to purchase on our online site or in any of our
          retail stores.

      <h3> Q: What if there is a problem with my order?</h3>
      <div>If you receive an incorrect, damaged, or defective item or the wrong order, please contact our Online
        Sales
        Department. Either email us at <a href="mailto:catalog@uwbookstore.com">onlinesales@uwbookstore.com</a>
        or call
        us at 800-993-2665, extension 5997. We will work with you to resolve the problem as soon as possible.
      </div>
      <h3> Q: Why do I have to enter my credit card information if I am using a gift card that covers the cost of
        the
        order?</h3>
      <div>A credit card is required for all orders. When an order is placed on our system no payments are
        collected
        until we actually ship the order. Our system does check with your credit/debit card provider to make
        sure that
        there are sufficient funds available to cover the total amount of the order (your financial institution
        might
        list this fund check with a “Pending” notation). That happens even if you have entered a gift card with
        a
        balance that covers the entire cost of the order. When your order is shipped our system will apply the
        gift card
        first. If that covers the total amount of the order your credit/debit card will not be billed anything.
        If the
        gift card covers a portion of the order total your credit/debit card will be billed the difference. Only
        if the
        gift card has no balance would the entire amount of the order be billed to your credit/debit card.</div>
      <h3> Q: How long does it take to process an order?</h3>
      <div>
        <!--Our order processing time is 3-4 business days for ground shipping and pick up at store or 1-2 business days for expedited orders. Your order will be shipped via UPS&reg;, FedEx&reg;, or USPS&reg; which will take 1-3 days (dependent on location and shipping method chosen) to reach you-->Our
        order processing time is 5-7 business days (Monday thru Friday) for ground shipping and store pick up or
        1-2
        business days for expedited orders. Your order will be shipped via UPS®, FedEx®, or USPS® which will
        take 1-3
        business days (dependent on location and shipping method chosen) to reach you.<br>
        <br>
        "Pick-up at store" orders have the same processing time as they are filled at our warehouse. You will
        receive
        notification when your order is ready for pick up.
      </div>
      <h3> Q: Why do I get an error message when trying to login?</h3>
      <div>
        There are two possible reasons.
        <ol>
          <li>You are using a different password than the one you used to create your account. Click the "Lost
            Your
            Password?" link to retrieve your password.</li>
          <li>You created your account with a different email address. If you would like to change the email
            address
            used with this account you will need to login with your old email address and change it.</li>
        </ol>
        If you are unable to remember which email address you used you may send an email to the webmaster by
        choosing
